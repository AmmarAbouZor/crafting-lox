# Crafting lOX

This repository will contains various Implementations of the LOX language as I'm moving forward with the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The Implementations in the book uses Java at the first part and C for the second one. 
My plan will be:
* Use Rust for the first run and replacing Java implementation on the fly. 
* Use C in the second part as provided by the book
* Provide my own implementation in Rust after finishing the book.
