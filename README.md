# Crafting lOX

This repository will contains various Implementations of the LOX language as I'm moving forward with the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

The Implementations in the book uses Java at the first part and C for the second one. 
My plan will be:
- [x] Use Rust for the first run and replacing Java implementation on the fly: 
The result is a working rust porting but it's not cleaned up and was ported immediately while going through the chapters of the book. 
- [x] Use C in the second part as provided by the book.
- [ ] Provide my own implementation in Rust after finishing the book. (Postponed)
